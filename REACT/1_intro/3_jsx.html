<!-- Familiar Syntax:
JSX looks like HTML: For anyone who has any experience with HTML, JSX feels familiar and easy to understand. It allows you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript files, making it simpler to visualize and design the UI within the context of the JavaScript code that handles logic.

Enhanced Readability:
Clear layout: By using JSX, the structure of the interface you're building is much clearer. This makes it easier for developers, including newcomers, to see the hierarchy and layout of the application's UI, making it more straightforward to understand and modify.

Component Structure:
Visual component structure: With JSX, componentsâ€™ structure is visually evident in the code, much like the layout of elements in a standard HTML page. This helps in visualizing parent-child relationships in the component hierarchy, making component-based development more intuitive.

Efficiency in Development:
Write less code: JSX allows you to write less boilerplate code than if you were using React.createElement calls. It automates the process of creating React elements with children, attributes, and event handlers, making the code not only shorter but also cleaner and less error-prone. -->
