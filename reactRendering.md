Real DOM
First things first, DOM stands for “Document Object Model”. The DOM in simple words represents the UI of your application. Every time there is a change in the state of your application UI, the DOM gets updated to represent that change. Now the catch is frequently manipulating the DOM affects performance, making it slow.

What makes DOM manipulation slow?
The DOM is represented as a tree data structure. Because of that, the changes and updates to the DOM are fast. But after the change, the updated element and its children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI. The re-rendering or re-painting of the UI is what makes it slow. Therefore, the more UI components you have, the more expensive the DOM updates could be, since they would need to be re-rendered for every DOM update.

DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern, interactive web. Unfortunately, it is also a lot slower than most JavaScript operations. This slowness is made worse by the fact that most JavaScript frameworks update the DOM much more than they have to.

As an example, let’s say that you have a list that contains ten items. You check off the first item. Most JavaScript frameworks would rebuild the entire list. That’s ten times more work than necessary! Only one item changed, but the remaining nine get rebuilt exactly how they were before.

Rebuilding a list is no big deal to a web browser, but modern websites can use huge amounts of DOM manipulation. Inefficient updating has become a serious problem. To address this problem, the people at React popularized something called the virtual DOM.

The Virtual DOM
In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy. A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing’s power to directly change what’s on the screen.

“The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.”

Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster because nothing gets drawn onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.

How is Virtual DOM faster?
When new elements are added to the UI, a virtual DOM, which is represented as a tree is created. Each element is a node on this tree. If the state of any of these elements changes, a new virtual DOM tree is created. This tree is then compared or “diffed” with the previous virtual DOM tree.

Once this is done, the virtual DOM calculates the best possible method to make these changes to the real DOM. This ensures that there are minimal operations on the real DOM. Hence, reducing the performance cost of updating the real DOM.


How does React use Virtual DOM?

React follows the observable pattern and listens for state changes.

In React every UI piece is a component, and each component has a state. When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM tree.

Once the virtual DOM has been updated, React then compares the current version of the virtual DOM with the previous version of the virtual DOM. This process is called “diffing”.

Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates only those objects, in the real DOM. This makes the performance far better when compared to manipulating the real DOM directly. This makes React stand out as a high-performance JavaScript library.

React follows a batch update mechanism to update the real DOM.
Hence, leading to increased performance. This means that updates to the real DOM are sent in batches, instead of sending updates for every single change in state.

The repainting of the UI is the most expensive part, and React efficiently ensures that the real DOM receives only batched updates to repaint the UI.

React follows an efficient Diffing Algorithm
React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:
a. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
b. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.
d. In practice, these assumptions are valid for almost all practical use cases.

When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of root elements.

Elements Of Different Types
Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch.

When tearing down a tree, old DOM nodes are destroyed. Component instances receive componentWillUnmount(). When building up a new tree, new DOM nodes are inserted into the DOM.

Any state associated with the old tree is lost.
Any components below the root will also get unmounted and have their state destroyed. For example, when diffing:

<div>
  <Counter />
</div>

<span>
  <Counter />
</span>

This will destroy the old Counter and remount a new one.

Recursing On Children Issue
By default, when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference.

For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well:

<ul>
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
  <li>third</li>
</ul>
React will match the two

first
trees, match the two
second
trees, and then insert the
third
tree.
If you implement it naively, inserting an element at the beginning has worse performance. For example, converting between these two trees works poorly:

<ul>
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Connecticut</li>
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul>
React will mutate every child instead of realizing it can keep the

Duke
and
Villanova
subtrees intact. This inefficiency can be a problem.
Use of Keys
In order to solve this issue, React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key to our inefficient example above can make the tree conversion efficient:

<ul>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
Now React knows that the element with key '2014' is the new one, and the elements with the keys '2015' and '2016' have just moved.

In practice, finding a key is usually not hard. The element you are going to display may already have a unique ID, so the key can just come from your data:

<li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
In this way you can use Keys for better performance in React!

React Fibre Architecture (Post Reads)
React Fiber Architecture
Introduction
React Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm. It is the culmination of over two years of research by the React team.

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

About this document
Fiber introduces several novel concepts that are difficult to grok solely by looking at code. This document began as a collection of notes I took as I followed along with Fiber's implementation in the React project. As it grew, I realized it may be a helpful resource for others, too.

I'll attempt to use the plainest language possible, and to avoid jargon by explicitly defining key terms. I'll also link heavily to external resources when possible.

Please note that I am not on the React team, and do not speak from any authority. This is not an official document. I have asked members of the React team to review it for accuracy.

This is also a work in progress. Fiber is an ongoing project that will likely undergo significant refactors before it's completed. Also ongoing are my attempts at documenting its design here. Improvements and suggestions are highly welcome.

My goal is that after reading this document, you will understand Fiber well enough to follow along as it's implemented, and eventually even be able to contribute back to React.

Prerequisites
I strongly suggest that you are familiar with the following resources before continuing:

React Components, Elements, and Instances - "Component" is often an overloaded term. A firm grasp of these terms is crucial.
Reconciliation - A high-level description of React's reconciliation algorithm.
React Basic Theoretical Concepts - A description of the conceptual model of React without implementation burden. Some of this may not make sense on first reading. That's okay, it will make more sense with time.
React Design Principles - Pay special attention to the section on scheduling. It does a great job of explaining the why of React Fiber.
Review
Please check out the prerequisites section if you haven't already.

Before we dive into the new stuff, let's review a few concepts.

What is reconciliation?
reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.
The central idea of React's API is to think of updates as if they cause the entire app to re-render. This allows the developer to reason declaratively, rather than worry about how to efficiently transition the app from any particular state to another (A to B, B to C, C to A, and so on).

Actually re-rendering the entire app on each change only works for the most trivial apps; in a real-world app, it's prohibitively costly in terms of performance. React has optimizations which create the appearance of whole app re-rendering while maintaining great performance. The bulk of these optimizations are part of a process called reconciliation.

Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM." A high-level description goes something like this: when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment — for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations. When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.

Although Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, the high-level algorithm described in the React docs will be largely the same. The key points are:

Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.
Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."
Reconciliation versus rendering
The DOM is just one of the rendering environments React can render to, the other major targets being native iOS and Android views via React Native. (This is why "virtual DOM" is a bit of a misnomer.)

The reason it can support so many targets is because React is designed so that reconciliation and rendering are separate phases. The reconciler does the work of computing which parts of a tree have changed; the renderer then uses that information to actually update the rendered app.

This separation means that React DOM and React Native can use their own renderers while sharing the same reconciler, provided by React core.

Fiber reimplements the reconciler. It is not principally concerned with rendering, though renderers will need to change to support (and take advantage of) the new architecture.

Scheduling
scheduling
the process of determining when work should be performed.
work
any computations that must be performed. Work is usually the result of an update (e.g. setState).
React's Design Principles document is so good on this subject that I'll just quote it here:

In its current implementation React walks the tree recursively and calls render functions of the whole updated tree during a single tick. However in the future it might start delaying some updates to avoid dropping frames.

This is a common theme in React design. Some popular libraries implement the "push" approach where computations are performed when the new data is available. React, however, sticks to the "pull" approach where computations can be delayed until necessary.

React is not a generic data processing library. It is a library for building user interfaces. We think that it is uniquely positioned in an app to know which computations are relevant right now and which are not.

If something is offscreen, we can delay any logic related to it. If data is arriving faster than the frame rate, we can coalesce and batch updates. We can prioritize work coming from user interactions (such as an animation caused by a button click) over less important background work (such as rendering new content just loaded from the network) to avoid dropping frames.

The key points are:

In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
Different types of updates have different priorities — an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.
A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.
React doesn't currently take advantage of scheduling in a significant way; an update results in the entire subtree being re-rendered immediately. Overhauling React's core algorithm to take advantage of scheduling is the driving idea behind Fiber.

Now we're ready to dive into Fiber's implementation. The next section is more technical than what we've discussed so far. Please make sure you're comfortable with the previous material before moving on.

What is a fiber?
We're about to discuss the heart of React Fiber's architecture. Fibers are a much lower-level abstraction than application developers typically think about. If you find yourself frustrated in your attempts to understand it, don't feel discouraged. Keep trying and it will eventually make sense. (When you do finally get it, please suggest how to improve this section.)

Here we go!

We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to

pause work and come back to it later.
assign priority to different types of work.
reuse previously completed work.
abort work if it's no longer needed.
In order to do any of this, we first need a way to break work down into units. In one sense, that's what a fiber is. A fiber represents a unit of work.

To go further, let's go back to the conception of React components as functions of data, commonly expressed as

v = f(d)
It follows that rendering a React app is akin to calling a function whose body contains calls to other functions, and so on. This analogy is useful when thinking about fibers.

The way computers typically track a program's execution is using the call stack. When a function is executed, a new stack frame is added to the stack. That stack frame represents the work that is performed by that function.

When dealing with UIs, the problem is that if too much work is executed all at once, it can cause animations to drop frames and look choppy. What's more, some of that work may be unnecessary if it's superseded by a more recent update. This is where the comparison between UI components and function breaks down, because components have more specific concerns than functions in general.

Newer browsers (and React Native) implement APIs that help address this exact problem: requestIdleCallback schedules a low priority function to be called during an idle period, and requestAnimationFrame schedules a high priority function to be called on the next animation frame. The problem is that, in order to use those APIs, you need a way to break rendering work into incremental units. If you rely only on the call stack, it will keep doing work until the stack is empty.

Wouldn't it be great if we could customize the behavior of the call stack to optimize for rendering UIs? Wouldn't it be great if we could interrupt the call stack at will and manipulate stack frames manually?

That's the purpose of React Fiber. Fiber is reimplementation of the stack, specialized for React components. You can think of a single fiber as a virtual stack frame.

The advantage of reimplementing the stack is that you can keep stack frames in memory and execute them however (and whenever) you want. This is crucial for accomplishing the goals we have for scheduling.

Aside from scheduling, manually dealing with stack frames unlocks the potential for features such as concurrency and error boundaries. We will cover these topics in future sections.

In the next section, we'll look more at the structure of a fiber.

Structure of a fiber
Note: as we get more specific about implementation details, the likelihood that something may change increases. Please file a PR if you notice any mistakes or outdated information.

In concrete terms, a fiber is a JavaScript object that contains information about a component, its input, and its output.

A fiber corresponds to a stack frame, but it also corresponds to an instance of a component.

Here are some of the important fields that belong to a fiber. (This list is not exhaustive.)

type and key
The type and key of a fiber serve the same purpose as they do for React elements. (In fact, when a fiber is created from an element, these two fields are copied over directly.)

The type of a fiber describes the component that it corresponds to. For composite components, the type is the function or class component itself. For host components (div, span, etc.), the type is a string.

Conceptually, the type is the function (as in v = f(d)) whose execution is being tracked by the stack frame.

Along with the type, the key is used during reconciliation to determine whether the fiber can be reused.

child and sibling
These fields point to other fibers, describing the recursive tree structure of a fiber.

The child fiber corresponds to the value returned by a component's render method. So in the following example

function Parent() {
  return <Child />
}
The child fiber of Parent corresponds to Child.

The sibling field accounts for the case where render returns multiple children (a new feature in Fiber!):

function Parent() {
  return [<Child1 />, <Child2 />]
}
The child fibers form a singly-linked list whose head is the first child. So in this example, the child of Parent is Child1 and the sibling of Child1 is Child2.

Going back to our function analogy, you can think of a child fiber as a tail-called function.

return
The return fiber is the fiber to which the program should return after processing the current one. It is conceptually the same as the return address of a stack frame. It can also be thought of as the parent fiber.

If a fiber has multiple child fibers, each child fiber's return fiber is the parent. So in our example in the previous section, the return fiber of Child1 and Child2 is Parent.

pendingProps and memoizedProps
Conceptually, props are the arguments of a function. A fiber's pendingProps are set at the beginning of its execution, and memoizedProps are set at the end.

When the incoming pendingProps are equal to memoizedProps, it signals that the fiber's previous output can be reused, preventing unnecessary work.

pendingWorkPriority
A number indicating the priority of the work represented by the fiber. The ReactPriorityLevel module lists the different priority levels and what they represent.

With the exception of NoWork, which is 0, a larger number indicates a lower priority. For example, you could use the following function to check if a fiber's priority is at least as high as the given level:

function matchesPriority(fiber, priority) {
  return fiber.pendingWorkPriority !== 0 &&
         fiber.pendingWorkPriority <= priority
}
This function is for illustration only; it's not actually part of the React Fiber codebase.

The scheduler uses the priority field to search for the next unit of work to perform. This algorithm will be discussed in a future section.

alternate
flush
To flush a fiber is to render its output onto the screen.
work-in-progress
A fiber that has not yet completed; conceptually, a stack frame which has not yet returned.
At any time, a component instance has at most two fibers that correspond to it: the current, flushed fiber, and the work-in-progress fiber.

The alternate of the current fiber is the work-in-progress, and the alternate of the work-in-progress is the current fiber.

A fiber's alternate is created lazily using a function called cloneFiber. Rather than always creating a new object, cloneFiber will attempt to reuse the fiber's alternate if it exists, minimizing allocations.

You should think of the alternate field as an implementation detail, but it pops up often enough in the codebase that it's valuable to discuss it here.

output
host component
The leaf nodes of a React application. They are specific to the rendering environment (e.g., in a browser app, they are `div`, `span`, etc.). In JSX, they are denoted using lowercase tag names.
Conceptually, the output of a fiber is the return value of a function.

Every fiber eventually has output, but output is created only at the leaf nodes by host components. The output is then transferred up the tree.

The output is what is eventually given to the renderer so that it can flush the changes to the rendering environment. It's the renderer's responsibility to define how the output is created and updated.

Future sections
That's all there is for now, but this document is nowhere near complete. Future sections will describe the algorithms used throughout the lifecycle of an update. Topics to cover include:

how the scheduler finds the next unit of work to perform.
how priority is tracked and propagated through the fiber tree.
how the scheduler knows when to pause and resume work.
how work is flushed and marked as complete.
how side-effects (such as lifecycle methods) work.
what a coroutine is and how it can be used to implement features like context and layout.
